ContentRicher - Enriching editorial content to address different knowledge levels

## Overview

ContentRicher enables media professionals, journalists and editors, to reach a wider audience by adding additional information to articles for different target groups with different levels of knowledge.

It is a web- and AI-based system that detects relevant parts in given texts that would benefit from additional explanation. It then retrieves additional information, identifies the most relevant parts and enriches the text seamlessly.

## Features
**- AI-based Retrieval of facts:** Based on state-of-the-art Large Language Models (choose between GPT-3.5 and Mistral) and Multimodal Models ContentRicher identifies persons in the text and retrieves relevant facts about them from Wikipedia and Instagram (from both text and images). 

**- Human-AI collaboration:** While the presented facts are already relevant to journalists and editors in the writing process, we also offer automatic integration of the facts: The relevant facts are proposed to the user, who can then select which facts they want to automatically integrate into the text (still to be implemented).

**- Userfriendly Interface:** Based on Streamlit, it offers a browser-based interface, with intuitive controls and display of the results.

## Running it

To run the app, create a virtual environment with python==3.9.11 as the python version:  
```conda create --name [PUT YOUR ENVIROMENT NAME HERE] python=3.9.11```  
Activate the environment with: 
```conda activate [PUT YOUR ENVIROMENT NAME HERE]```  
Then change to the ./app folder  
```cd app/```  
and install the libraries from the requirements.txt via:  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
Change into the experiments folder  
```cd experiments/```  
Then, open the .env file in the experiments folder. You may need to press ```CMD + SHIFT + .``` to show the file.  Insert your key/s in the placeholders
```API_KEY = "[YOUR OPENAI API KEY HERE]"``` (for using GPT-3.5 from OpenAI) and/or put   
```MISTRAL_API_KEY = "[YOUR MISTRAL_API KEY HERE]"``` (for using the Mistral Small Model).  
Finally, run the app from the experiments folder with:  
```streamlit run frontend_experiments.py```

## Current state of development

Currently, we retrieve information from Wikipedia. The next step will be to include information from Instagram (both from text and images).
